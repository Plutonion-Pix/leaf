# What is Leaf ?

Leaf is a programming language. It's purpose is to fulfill a maximum of features in the easiest way possible.
But it's also a software because of it's functionalities. It can :
1. Compile Leaf code.
2. Interpret Leaf code.
3. Install updates.
4. Remove itself (of course).
5. Translate Leaf code to many other languages.
6. Translate many languages to Leaf.
7. Debug Leaf code.
8. Find memory leaks.
9. Install packages, libraries, modules and headers from [here](www.lexip.org/leaf/install/).
10. Upload packages, libraries, modules and headers. (They are verified before uploading, but remember that there are bad people in life)
11. And more coming soon ! ~(˘▾˘~)

# Hello world
Here are some hello worlds in Leaf.

The basic one.
```cpp
#include llib

main() {
  print("Hello world")
}
```

The fastest in compile-time.
```cpp
#include std

main() {
  printf("Hello world\n")
}
```

The "like C++" one.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std

int main() {
  cout << "Hello world" << endl
}
```

_Note : the "std" in "#include std" have nothing to do with the "std" of iostream._

# Where can I find the doc ?

You can find the doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwhFTFn02VZi5Zf8MhOeVVoHBZ07RyTEomSO1AfFHCs/edit?usp=sharing)

Please keep in mind that Leaf is in constant devlopment and can have a lot of bugs.
